# Installation

1. Run `yarn`
2. Ensure that you have a `.env` file in the `voltz-ui` directory with the following:

```
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_NETWORK=<<RPC ENDPOINT FOR BLOCKCHAIN>
REACT_APP_REQUIRED_ETHEREUM_NETWORK=<<ETHEREUM_NETWORK_NAME>>
REACT_APP_SUBGRAPH_URL=<<URL OF LOCAL SUBGRAPH>>
REACT_APP_TOS_URL=https://www.voltz.xyz/t-cs
REACT_APP_TRM_API_KEY=<<TRM_API_KEY>>
REACT_APP_WALLETCONNECT_INFURA_ID=<<INFURA ID>>
```

Optional:
```
REACT_APP_ROLLOVER_VALIDATE_ONLY=Y
REACT_APP_SKIP_TOS_CHECK=Y
REACT_APP_SKIP_WALLET_SCREENING=Y
```

`REACT_APP_REQUIRED_ETHEREUM_NETWORK` is used by the app to check that the connected Metamask wallet is using the correct network. Use `homestead` for Ethereum Mainnet (live), or `goerli` for Kovan Testnet (dev).

`REACT_APP_WALLETCONNECT_INFURA_ID` is used by the app when attempting to use the WalletConnect wallet option. Sign up for an account at https://infura.io/ and then create a new project. The 'infura id' is the same as the 'project id' in the keys section.

`REACT_APP_TOS_URL` This is the URL displayed in the terms of service (TOS) message that users must agree to before they can connect their wallet to the app.

`REACT_APP_TRM_API_KEY` This key is used to get a risk assessment from TRM for a wallet that is being connected to the app. If you don't have an API key, you will need to disable wallet screening to able to use your wallet.

`REACT_APP_SKIP_TOS_CHECK` If this key exists, the app will not check that the user has agreed to the terms of service (TOS). It is intended to be used on dev/test environments.

`REACT_APP_SKIP_WALLET_SCREENING` If this key exists, the app will not check if the wallet is deemed risky (via TRM). It is intended to be used on dev/test environments.

`REACT_APP_WHITELIST` This key contains a subset of all deployed pools as a comma separated list of IDs. This subset should be visible in the production Voltz front-end. If you want to remove a pool from the production front-end remove it from this key, please.

`REACT_APP_ROLLOVER_VALIDATE_ONLY` If this is set, rollover operations will have the `validateOnly` flag set to true. This can be useful for testing / debugging.

# Run

1. Run `yarn start`

# Testing local version of SDK using `yalc`

Refer to documentation of this process found in `README.md` of SDK. Follow this [link](https://github.com/Voltz-Protocol/v1-sdk#testing-local-version-in-ui-using-yalc) for details.

## Branching model

UI needs to be available on both [https://test.voltz.xyz](test.voltz.xyz) and [https://app.voltz.xyz](app.voltz.xyz) at same time with different version of code. 
Hence, we need to have 2 branches each representing the env. we deploy to. `main` branch relates to `app.voltz.xyz` aka `production` and 
`develop` branch relates to `test.voltz.xyz` aka `test`.

In the UI world you should branch off develop when building a feature. 
So just go on `develop`, pull latest and then branch out of it. 
Create your PR against `develop`.

The `main` branch is just a snapshot of `develop` at given point in time, 
so no need to do any developing against `main`, 
and we just simple merge `develop` to `main` whenever we want to do a release.

Branch naming is quite standard, we tried to duplicate what we have done for 
the committing messages, following standard commit message format: [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/].

Branch names can start with the prefixes found in the regex under '.husky/pre-commit'.

### Short summary:

**DEVELOPING**
  * create a branch from `develop`, follow the naming convention for a branch
  * wait for approval, resolve comments and make sure you have a green build
  * merge to `develop` using **Rebase and merge**

**RELEASING**

This section explains the process of creating a release candidate branch out of current `develop` and `main`.

**Important**: Make sure you have no changes on `develop` or `main`!

Short version:

At the root of repository, execute:
```shell
    FEATURE='my-release-feature' yarn git:create-release-branch
```

Long version:
 * create a branch from `develop`
   * name it `release/my-release-feature` (**important** since this branch will create AWS Amplify env. where you can test your build before you merge/release it!)
   * add proper description! Important since this will be automatically included in the merge commit message
   * good practice is to include the release date into branch name for visibility, in the format `YYYYMMDD` 
 * git merge `main` to that branch
   * if any conflicts, resolve them by accepting all changes from `release/YYYYMMDD`
 * create a PR against `main`
 * wait for approval, resolve comments and make sure you have a green build
 * merge to `main` using **Create a merge commit**

## AWS Amplify

Voltz UI uses AWS Amplify to create automate the process around creating builds that can be shared with the stakeholders.
What this means is that any push to a branch will create an environment for the team to test against!

### Rules

**Environment branches (main & develop)**
* merges to branch `main` always deploy to `app.voltz.xyz` with ENV variables specific for `main`
* merges to branch `develop` always deploy to `test.voltz.xyz` with ENV variables specific for `develop`

**Candidate branches:**
* commits on branches that follow the pattern `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `refactor/*` and `test/*` generate a build with same ENV variables as `develop`
* commits on branches that follow the pattern `release/*` generate a build with same ENV variables as `main` 

## Tools

Helpful tools to install to improve your development life!
* [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
* [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd/related?hl=en)
* [Metamask Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)

For local development purposes it is advised to install `Metamask` wallet. You can install the Google Chrome extension for this.
Once you have the wallet setup you should enable the test networks for the `Metamask` wallet `Account Settings` -> `Advanced` -> `Show test networks`.
Next time around you want to test on localhost, just select the `goerli` test network from your wallet.
