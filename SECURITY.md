# Security Policy

Security is of the utmost importance to us and we strive to make our software as secure as possible for our users. However, no system is completely immune to vulnerabilities, so if you believe you have found a security issue in our software, we would greatly appreciate your help in disclosing it to us.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please do not disclose it publicly. Instead, please contact us directly by submitting a ticket in our  [discord support channel](https://discord.com/channels/896685581487210577/1005057396160336004). This will ensure that the issue is addressed as quickly and discreetly as possible. We ask that you provide as much detail as possible about the issue, including steps to reproduce it, and any relevant information such as affected versions of the software.

Alternatively, you can also report the issue through GitHub's built-in issue tracking system by clicking on the "Issues" tab in the repository and creating a new issue. When creating the issue, please use the label "security" to ensure that it is properly identified and handled as a security issue.

We will investigate all reported security issues as quickly as possible and take appropriate action to address them. We appreciate your help in keeping our software and users secure.

Please note: Any attempt to exploit a security vulnerability without prior permission from the maintainers will be considered a violation of our security policy and will result in immediate action.
